# Starbucks Reimagined
As an avid Starbucks customer turned partner, I decided I wanted to make a tribute to Starbucks by redesigning the website in the '90s style.
At the time, the company was rapidly expanding the brand and experimenting with a new type of blended beverage, the frappucino, and refreshers.
This project takes influence from many popular themes and elements from the '90s- repeating backgrounds, bold colors, funny GIFs and banner ads.

## Features
The website has different sections of information about the company, the company's values, and the "current" news of certain releases/launches.
Includes a full menu of hot/cold drinks, seasonal favorites, and frappucinos- a picture of the drink, the name, and a short description what the drink is.

## How to Navigate
Simply click on one of the icon tabs on the top of the website to show a different component of the website.
There are multiple different options- Home, Coffees, Specialty, Frappuccinos, Seasonal, and Beans. The page will then display the respective menu.
To get back to the homepage, click the home button.

The sidebar navigation links were popular at the time, but are not active links on this sight (not finished--> just for show).

## Tech Stack
This project utilized the original stack that was used back in the '90s.
HTML for the basic content of the page, CSS to format the page, and JS to get the tabs interactive with page display.

## To Finish
If given more time, for this project I'd love to add the section on beans and work on some pages/info for the side links provided on the website.
I'd also dedicate more time to the formatting of the page styling itself- adding fun fonts and colors.
